Semester_of_R
=============

The answers on this repository pretain to the semester one module "Probability and Statistics" in Dublin City University run by Dr. Liam Tuohey.  The goal is to have all of the labs attempted and uploaded before my exam starts as a method of study.  Not all the answers will be 100% correct so if you notice something, drop me a line.  

I will be uploading the PDF of questions with the R scripts.
